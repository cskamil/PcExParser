#Step 1: Define a 4x10 two-dimensional list

'''@helpDescription(Note that each matrix row corresponds to a sublist in the two-dimensional list. Also, note that lists can naturally span multiple lines if we want them to because they are contained by a pair of brackets.)''' 
ratings_data = [[3, 4, 5, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 4, 4],

                [1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4]]

#Step 2: Compute the maximum rating for each soda
'''@helpDescription(We store the number of rows in the two-dimensional list ratings_data in variable num_sodas because we'll use it in different steps of the program. Note that the function len(ratings_data) returns the number of rows in the two-dimensional list ratings_data)'''

Here, we need four variables for storing the maximum rating for each soda; so, we create a list of length 4.)'''

The repetition operator makes N copies of this list and joins them all together into a single list, where N is the number of sodas stored in variable num_sodas, here, 4.
